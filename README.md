# Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a method used in recommendation systems to predict the preferences of a user by analyzing preferences from a large number of other users. It works by identifying patterns or similarities among users or items.

## Types of Collaborative Filtering

### User-Based Collaborative Filtering

- **Method**: Finds users similar to the target user and recommends items that those similar users liked.
- **Example**: If User A and User B have similar tastes, items liked by User B will be recommended to User A.

### Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

- **Method**: Finds items similar to the ones the target user has liked and recommends those similar items.
- **Example**: If User A liked Movie X and Movie X is similar to Movie Y, then Movie Y is recommended to User A.
